# CPU-Schedulers-Simulator

Java program to simulate the following schedulers:

*Non-preemptive Priority Scheduling using context switching

*Non-Preemptive Shortest- Job First (SJF)

*Shortest- Remaining Time First (SRTF) Scheduling

*FCAI Scheduling (Custom Algorithm):
An adaptive scheduling algorithm that combines:
-Priority
-Arrival time
-Remaining burst time
-Dynamic quantum allocation
-Hybrid non-preemptive and preemptive execution
